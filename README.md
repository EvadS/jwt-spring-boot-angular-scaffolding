This project is a multi-module application, using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The project can be built into a single jar file using Maven. You can also run the modules separately during development.

The backend and frontend are secured with JSON Web Token.

$ git clone https://github.com/little-pinecone/jwt-spring-boot-angular-scaffolding.git
```

You can build the application with:

### Sign up request

You need to create a test user:

* path: ```http://localhost:8080/api/users```

* body:

```json
{
    "userCredentials": {
        "username": "user",
        "password": "test"
    }
}
```

## Overview and technical features

* The project currently serves a login page and hard-coded pastry data returned from the API.
* It allows registering new users, handles login requests.
* It serves data from the API to authenticated and authorized users.
* The user experience is enhanced thanks to the AuthGuard implementation.

## Running tests

Run all backend tests with the following command in the root directory:
```bash
$ mvn test
```
Run all frontend tests with the following command in the `frontend/src/main/angular` directory:
```bash
$ ng test
```

## Running in production

Set the `apiUrl` const in `frontend/src/main/angular/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` to the path for the production environment.

Override the default `TokenProperties` values. E.g. to override the expiration time of tokens you can add `security.jwt.expiration=your_value` to the `application.properties` file.
